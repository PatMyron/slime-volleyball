2 player volleyball game written in C using x11 graphics

<h1>How this program works for the user:<h1>

The game starts with a menu where the two players are asked to input
their names. The keys for each player are beautifully drawn on the
screen as well to instruct the players how to play. Then, the game
starts with the ball bouncing on one player. They move left, right,
and jump to hit the ball and play volleyball. They play until one
player scores 3 points. It displays the winner and asks you to press
‘c’ to get to the menu. In the menu, they can choose to play again
(p), see stats (s), change names (n), or quit (q). They can go through
this menu after every game played. The program runs until they quit
through the menu or press escape during a game being played.
